title: Excluders
---
Sometimes it's difficult to pick only the files that you need. For example,
it might be convenient to pick an entire directory, but there might be a few
files in that directory that an author doesn't want to include. To solve this
problem, Static Shock provides `Excluder`s.

An `Excluder` is similar to a `Picker`, except every file that matches the
`Excluder` is kept out of the pipeline.

Consider the common Mac file called `.DS_Store`. This pesky file is autogenerated
by Mac in most directories. This file should probably never be picked for
processing. For this reason, by default, Static Shock registers an `Excluder`
for any file that begins with a `.`.

```dart
const FilePrefixExcluder(".")
```

Plugins can register their own `Excluder`s.

```dart
@override
FutureOr<void> configure(
  StaticShockPipeline pipeline,
  StaticShockPipelineContext context,
  StaticShockCache pluginCache,
) {
  pipeline.exclude(const FilePrefixExcluder("."));
}
```

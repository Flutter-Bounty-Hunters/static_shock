title: Work on an Issue
---
The Flutter Bounty Hunters welcome code contributions from developers who are
excited about, and invested in Static Shock.

Before working on an issue, please be sure to ask the team to assign it to you.
We wouldn't want multiple people to spend their time solving the same problem.

You should also provide some information about your familiarity with the task,
and what you plan to do to implement it. We wouldn't want you to go down a long
path that ends up failing at the end.

## Follow Patterns
When fixing a bug, or implementing a feature, try to match your code style to
the existing Static Shock code. We will enforce consistency wherever possible,
so we recommend focusing on consistency from the very beginning. Otherwise, it
might be frustrating to finish implementing the ticket, and then have to rewrite
most of the code to honor existing styles and patterns.

## Tests
Tests are critical. Static Shock includes a lot of overlapping behaviors. It's
easy to change a behavior in place only to have it break a behavior somewhere else.

You should expect to write tests for every bug fix and every feature.

To help you, we've published an entire section on [testing](contributing/testing/overview/).

## Documentation
What you're reading right now is documentation. The only reason these words exist is
because a human sat down and wrote them. Every capability within Static Shock is
worthy of documentation. Every contributor should expect to write some amount
of documentation.

Documentation takes three forms:
 * Website guides
 * DartDoc comments (in code)
 * Inline comments (in code)

Contributors are expected to write all three types of documentation, where valuable.

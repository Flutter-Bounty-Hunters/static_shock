An easy way to contribute to Static Shock is to file a bug report or a
feature request. Please make sure to provide sufficient information when
you do so, otherwise we may be unable to help.

## Bug Reports
The most important thing about a bug report is that our team be able to
reproduce the bug. If we can't reproduce it, we can't fix it.

Every bug report must provide a reproduction steps. These are steps that
our team can take to recreate the bug. The reproduction steps should include
relevant platform information, such as your operating system type and version,
and any other contextual information that might be required to recreate
the bug.

## Feature Requests
The most important thing about a feature request, is to help us understand
why it's valuable. Don't worry about implementation details. Tell us about
the goal you're trying to accomplish, and where Static Shock is failing
you.

A developer will figure out the most appropriate place to add the feature
that solves your problem.

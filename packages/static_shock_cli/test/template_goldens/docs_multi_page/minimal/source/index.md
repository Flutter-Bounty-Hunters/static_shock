Thanks for choosing Static Shock to build your documentation website!

## Our Mission
Static Shock's mission is to help all Flutter and Dart package developers
to write and publish great documentation websites.

Every package deserves a documentation website. Small packages might only
require a few pages of guides. Larger projects might need to document multiple
packages in a mono repo with hundreds of guides. We're here to help!

## Tools
Here are some notable tools that we've built in to this template for your
convenience:

#### External Links
 * Link to sponsorship page for your package
 * Link to GitHub repo for your package
 * Link to Pub generated documentation for your package
 * Link to your Discord channel

#### Styling
 * HighlightJS for syntax highlighting

#### Package Info
 * Show the top contributors to your package

#### Text Search
 * Algolia full-text search integration

To take advantage of these tools, you either need to fill out the appropriate
questions when generating this project, or you can alter the top-level `_data.yaml`
configuration in your Static Shock project.

Of course, you also inherit all general purpose features that are provided by
[Static Shock](https://staticshock.io), like Markdown authoring, Jinja template
rendering, pretty URL generation, and more.

## Next Steps
What you're looking at right now is our starter template for Flutter and Dart
documentation websites. If you're not sure what to do with this template, head
over to <https://staticshock.io> and checkout our guides for working with
documentation websites.

## Deployment
You can deploy your static website on any web server you'd like. However, if
you're an indie developer based on GitHub, we recommend trying a [deployment
through GitHub pages](https://staticshock.io/guides/deploy-to-github-pages), 
which is free, and you can automate it with a GitHub action.

# Static Shock
A static site generator, written in dart.

## Quickstart
Generate a new Static Shock project with `static_shock_cli`:

    # Activate the CLI tool.
    dart pub global activate static_shock_cli

    # Generate a new project.
    shock create

Once you've created a project, you can (re)build your static site as needed:

    dart bin/my_site.dart

To demo your static site, run a local server from your project directory, using the CLI tool:

    shock serve
